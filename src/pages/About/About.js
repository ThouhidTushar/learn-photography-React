			<h3>I invite you to discover the power of photography in coaching.There is something very unique about photography in our lives nowadays.We all take photos and communicate through them every day.Every important moment or relationship is in a photo.
				<br />
				<br />
				“Photographs contain meanings beyond their visual contents, in ways that words alone cannot express.They hold stories and reasons for being taken, posed for, kept, remembered, or mourned if lost.The memories and emotions that photographs unconsciously trigger can be useful in helping individuals explore various aspects of themselves and their lives.

				– Judy Weiser, Founder and Director of the PhotoTherapy Centre in Dhaka, Bangladesh</h3>
